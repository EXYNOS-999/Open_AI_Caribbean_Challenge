Open AI Caribbean Challenge: Mapping Disaster Risk from Aerial Imagery 


Overview

In areas like the Caribbean that face considerable risk from natural hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods, these forces of nature can have a devastating effect. This is especially true where houses and buildings are not up to modern construction standards, often in poor and informal settlements. While buildings can be retrofit to better prepare them for disaster, the traditional method for identifying high-risk buildings involves going door to door by foot, taking weeks if not months and costing millions of dollars.

This is where AI can help. WeRobotics and the World Bank Global Program for Resilient Housing have teamed up to prepare aerial drone imagery of buildings across the Caribbean annotated with characteristics that matter to building inspectors. One particularly relevant characteristic is roof construction material. Roof material is one of the main risk factors for earthquakes and hurricanes and a predictor of other risk factors, like building material, that are as not readily seen from the air.



In this challenge, my goal is to use provided aerial imagery to classify the roof material of identified buildings in St. Lucia, Guatemala, and Colombia. Machine learning models that are able to most accurately map disaster risk from drone imagery will help drive faster, cheaper prioritization of building inspections and target resources for disaster preparation where they will have the most impact.

WeRobotics and partners have carried out a number of Open AI Challenges over the years to help translate aerial data into actionable analytics for decision making. We have held these Open AI Challenges in the South Pacific, for example, and in Tanzania most recently. We now turn our attention to the Caribbean. Communities living in housing that is not up to appropriate construction standards are at the highest risk from a natural disaster. This risk is especially real for people living in poverty and informal settlements. While buildings can be modified to withstand disasters better, identifying those buildings is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and exorbitantly expensive

That’s why we’re teaming up with the World Bank Global Program for Resilient Housing to help governments across the Caribbean use drone imagery to more quickly and more cost-effectively identify buildings that need to be prioritized for fortification against disasters. Drone imagery and AI can help accomplish this by automatically identifying the roof construction material, which is an important risk factor for earthquakes and hurricanes, and a useful predictor for other risk factors, such as building material. 

In this $10,000 challenge, applicants will use high resolution aerial imagery from St. Lucia, Guatemala and Colombia to help develop machine learning classifiers that can automatically detect roof materials. A robust machine learning model that can accurately map the disaster risk for these areas will help identify priority buildings more quickly while driving overall costs down, thus increasing the impact of this resiliency effort.
